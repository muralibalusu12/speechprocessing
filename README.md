# speechprocessing
assignments given during the speech processing course. The codes are self explanatory with inline comments. 

Inside Kmeans folder: 
1. kmeans_visual studio - A visual studio project file containing the code for Kmeans algorithm to calculate the codebook for the speech input feature vectors.
2. kmeans_cpp - A cpp file for the kmeans algorithm again for the same purpose and the input and output files.


Inside LBG_algorithm folder: 
1. LBG_visualstudio - A visual studio project file containing the code for LBG algorithm to calculate the codebook for the speech input feature vectors.
2. LBG_cpp - A cpp file for the LBG algorithm again for the same purpose and the input and output files.
3. lbg_distortion_iteration_graph - contains a graph of distortion versus iteration
