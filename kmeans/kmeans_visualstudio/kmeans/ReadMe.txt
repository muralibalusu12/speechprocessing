Assignment 5: K-Means
Visual Studio Version: 2013

Steps to execute the code:
1. You can find the input for the program the file Universe.txt which is present inside the k-means folder.

2. The configuration settings are taken from "configuration.txt". 
   The program take the size of the codebook and the weights to be used in Tokhura's distance calculation as inputs.
   
3. Codebook is present in the Codebook.txt file.
   All the mean vectors of each of the clusters -32 are written here.
   The output is printed into Logfile.txt
   It contains the intermediate outputs like the number of vectors that are allotted to each cluster as we run the kmeans          algorithm. 
   It also contains the distortion of the current codebook at each run of the kmeans algorithm.
   Another file Distrotion.txt is generated. It contains the distortion of the current codebook at each run of the kmeans          algorithm.
   
4. Open the solution file, run F5 to build and run. The output file can be seen in the Codebook.txt, Logfile.txt and the           distortion in the Distortion.txt
